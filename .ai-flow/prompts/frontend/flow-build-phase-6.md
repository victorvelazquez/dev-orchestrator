## PHASE 6: Testing Strategy (15-20 min)

> **Order for this phase:**
>
> - **MVP:** 6.1 → 6.2 (smoke tests) → 6.7 (CI basics)
> - **Production-Ready:** 6.1 → 6.1b → 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4 → 6.5 → 6.6 → 6.7
> - **Enterprise:** 6.1 → 6.1b → 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4 → 6.5 → 6.6 → 6.7 → 6.8 → 6.9

> **📌 Scope-based behavior:**
>
> - **MVP:** Ask 6.1 (framework), 6.2 (smoke tests only), 6.7 (CI basics) - **Target: 15-25% coverage**
> - **Production-Ready:** Ask all questions 6.1-6.7 - **Target: 60-80% coverage**
> - **Enterprise:** Ask all questions 6.1-6.9 - **Target: 80-95% coverage + contract/load tests**

### Objective

Define testing approach, tools, and quality gates.

**🚨 Important: All projects require basic testing. Scope determines depth, not whether to test.**

## 🔍 Pre-Flight Check (Smart Skip Logic)

> 📎 **Reference:** See [prompts/shared/smart-skip-preflight.md](../../.ai-flow/prompts/shared/smart-skip-preflight.md) for the complete smart skip logic.

**Execute Pre-Flight Check for Phase 6:**

- **Target File**: `docs/testing.md`
- **Phase Name**: "TESTING STRATEGY"
- **Key Items**: Test framework, coverage targets, test types, CI/CD integration
- **Typical Gaps**: E2E strategy, load testing, performance testing

**Proceed with appropriate scenario based on audit data from `.ai-flow/cache/audit-data.json`**

📖 Loading context from previous phases...
✅ Re-reading docs/code-standards.md
✅ Re-reading ai-instructions.md
```

**Generate `docs/testing.md` automatically:**

- Use template: `.ai-flow/templates/docs/testing.template.md`
- **If MVP scope:** Fill with basic testing strategy: framework selection, smoke tests on critical paths, coverage 15-25%, basic CI setup. Mark advanced sections as "Not implemented yet - expand when moving to Production-Ready"
- **If Production-Ready:** Fill with comprehensive testing strategy: framework, unit/integration/e2e tests, 60-80% coverage, test data management, mocking, full CI/CD
- **If Enterprise:** Fill with exhaustive testing strategy: all Production-Ready items + contract tests, load tests, security tests, 80-95% coverage, performance benchmarks
- Write to: `docs/testing.md`

```
