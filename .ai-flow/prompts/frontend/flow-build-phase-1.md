## PHASE 1: Discovery & Business (15-20 min)

> **Order for this phase:** 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6 → 1.7 → 1.8 → 1.9 → 1.10

> **📌 Scope-based behavior:**
> - **MVP/Basic Scope:** Focus only on core requirements. Skip advanced business logic questions.
> - **Production-Ready Scope:** In-depth exploration of compliance, scalability, and long-term business goals.

### Objective
Define the project's core purpose, business rules, and high-level requirements to ensure the foundation is solid before technical design begins.

## 🔍 Pre-Flight Check (Smart Skip Logic)

> 📎 **Reference:** See [prompts/shared/smart-skip-preflight.md](../../.ai-flow/prompts/shared/smart-skip-preflight.md) for the complete smart skip logic.

**Execute Pre-Flight Check for Phase 1:**

- **Target File**: `project-brief.md`
- **Phase Name**: "BUSINESS CONTEXT"
- **Key Items**: Project name, description, users, objectives, system type, features, scope, constraints, metrics, business flows
- **Typical Gaps**: Business objectives, success metrics, constraints

**Proceed with appropriate scenario based on audit data from `.ai-flow/cache/audit-data.json`**

---

## Phase 1 Questions (Full Mode)

> **📌 Note:** If Phase 0 was executed, some questions may already be answered. Skip those and only ask what's missing.

**1.1 Project Name & Description (with Smart Refinement)**

> **🧠 Intelligent Refinement System**: This question detects vague descriptions and guides the developer to enrich them. It only asks what's missing and responds in the developer's language.

```
[If detected from Phase 0, show:]
✅ Project Name: [detected name]
✅ Description: [detected description]

Is this correct? (Y/N)
If no, please provide correct values.

[If NOT detected, ask:]
What is the project name?

Provide an initial description of your project.
(Don't worry about perfection - we'll refine it together if needed!)

Example: "A backend for managing gym memberships"
```

**🔍 AI Internal: Ambiguity Analysis**

After receiving the description, silently analyze for these criteria:

| Criterion | Check For | Score +1 if present |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **WHO** | Specific user type mentioned (not just "users") | "gym members", "restaurant owners" |
| **WHAT** | Specific action/function (not just "manage") | "track workouts", "process payments" |
| **WHY** | Purpose or value mentioned | "to replace spreadsheets", "to launch app" |
| **DOMAIN** | Industry/vertical indicated | "fitness", "fintech", "healthcare" |
| **DETAIL** | Description has 10+ meaningful words | Not counting articles |

**Scoring Rules:**
- Score 4-5: ✅ Accept immediately → Proceed to 1.2
- Score 0-3: ⚠️ Enter refinement loop → Ask ONLY missing criteria

---

**🔄 Conditional Refinement Loop (only if score < 4)**

> **CRITICAL**: Only ask about criteria that are MISSING. Do NOT repeat questions already answered. Respond in the SAME LANGUAGE the developer used.

```

```
[If 1.1 refinement was complete (score >= 4), show:]

✅ Based on your description, I understand:
   • Users: [WHO from 1.1]
   • Core Action: [WHAT from 1.1]
   • Purpose: [WHY from 1.1]

Is this complete? (Y) Or would you like to add more context? (N)

[If user says Y → Skip to 1.3]
[If user says N → Ask:]
What additional context would you like to add?

---

[If 1.1 was NOT refined OR any WHO/WHAT/WHY still missing, ask:]

[ONLY ask for MISSING elements - check what was NOT captured in 1.1:]

[If WHO still unclear:]
Who are the primary users of this system?

[If WHAT still unclear:]
What is the core value proposition?

[If WHY still unclear:]
What makes this project necessary?

Example:
"A backend for a fitness tracking mobile app used by gym-goers (users). It allows users to log workouts, track progress over time, and share achievements with friends (value). This project is necessary to replace our legacy spreadsheet-based system and support our new iOS app launch."
```

**1.3 Target Users (Confirmation + Additional Types)**

**1.10 Main Business Flows**

> Note: If you omit any common flow or functionality, the AI will suggest and document typical processes relevant to your system type, based on best practices and common use cases.

`````
List the main business flows of the system (e.g., sales, inventory update, invoicing, user registration).

For each flow, you can add a brief description (optional).

If you wish, you can specify the main steps of any flow (numbered format). If you do not specify them, the AI will deduce typical steps based on the name and description.

Example:
- Sales: Process of purchasing products by the customer.
  1. Customer selects products
  2. Order is created
  3. Inventory is updated
  4. Invoice is generated
- Inventory: Automatic stock update after each sale.
- Invoicing: Invoice generation after purchase.

The AI will automatically generate flow diagrams (mermaid) for each documented process.

**Flowchart Syntax:**
- `flowchart TD` = Top-Down flow (recommended)
- `flowchart LR` = Left-Right flow
- `flowchart BT` = Bottom-Top
- `flowchart RL` = Right-Left

**Node Shapes:**
- `[Rectangle]` = Process step/action
- `{Diamond}` = Decision point (Yes/No, multiple options)
- `([Rounded Rectangle])` = Start/End terminal
- `[(Cylinder)]` = Database operation
- `[[Subroutine]]` = Sub-process
- `[/Parallelogram/]` = Input/Output
- `((Circle))` = Connection point

**Arrow Types:**
- `-->` = Solid arrow (standard flow)
- `-.->` = Dotted arrow (optional/conditional)
- `==>` = Thick arrow (emphasis)
- `-->|Label|` = Labeled arrow (decision branch)

**Best Practices for Business Flows:**
1. **Always start with a terminal**: `([Start])`
2. **Always end with a terminal**: `([End])`
3. **Label decision branches**: Use `-->|Yes|` or `-->|No|`
4. **Use line breaks in labels**: `{Continue<br/>Shopping?}` for readability
5. **Apply consistent styling**: Same colors for similar node types
6. **Keep it readable**: Avoid spaghetti flows, group related steps
7. **Show all paths**: Every decision should have all branches defined
8. **Include error paths**: Payment failures, validation errors, etc.

**Multiple Flow Example (Advanced):**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Customer Journey"
        C1[Browse] --> C2[Select]
        C2 --> C3[Purchase]
    end

    subgraph "Backend Processing"
        B1[Validate Order] --> B2[Process Payment]
        B2 --> B3[Update Inventory]
        B3 --> B4[Send Notifications]
    end

    C3 --> B1
    B4 --> C4[Confirmation]
```

**Color Coding Guide:**
- Blue (`#e1f5ff`): Start/Entry points
- Green (`#e1ffe1`): Success/Completion
- Red (`#ffe1e1`): Failure/Error states
- Yellow (`#fff4e1`): Critical operations (Payment, Auth)
- Purple (`#f0e1ff`): External integrations

**Common Business Flows to Document:**
- User Registration/Login
- Purchase/Checkout Process
- Content Creation/Publishing
- Approval/Review Workflows
- Data Import/Export
- Notification/Alert Flows
- Customer Support Ticket Lifecycle

**Validation:** Test at https://mermaid.live/ before saving
