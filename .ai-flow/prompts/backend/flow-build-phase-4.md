## PHASE 4: Security & Authentication (15-20 min)

> **Order for this phase:** 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4 → 4.5 → 4.6 → 4.7 → 4.8 → 4.9 → 4.10 → 4.11

> **📌 Scope-based behavior:**
>
> - **MVP:** Ask 4.1-4.5 only (auth basics + CORS), skip 4.6-4.11 (advanced security), mark as "TBD"
> - **Production-Ready:** Ask 4.1-4.8 and 4.11, skip or simplify 4.9 (compliance) and 4.10 (audit logging)
> - **Enterprise:** Ask all questions 4.1-4.11 with emphasis on compliance and audit trails

### Objective

Define security policies, authentication, authorization, and compliance requirements.

- Stateless, scalable
- Access + Refresh token pattern

B) 🔥 Session-based - Traditional web apps

- Server-side sessions
- Cookie-based

C) ⚡ OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect - External providers

- "Sign in with Google/GitHub/etc."
- Delegated authentication

D) 🏆 Multi-factor (MFA) - Enterprise security

- OTP, SMS, authenticator app
- Required or optional?

E) API Keys - Service-to-service

Some projects must follow legal requirements or industry standards. If you're not sure, you can select "None" and add compliance requirements later.

Select all that apply:

A) 🌍 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
   What it is: EU data privacy regulation
   When it applies: If you process personal data of users in the European Union

```

**4.13 Input Validation & Sanitization**

```
Input validation strategy:

A) ⭐ Strict validation with DTOs/Schemas (Recommended)
   - Use validation library: [class-validator/Zod/Pydantic/Joi from Phase 3.6]
   - Reject unknown fields: [yes/no]
   - Type coercion: [strict/lenient]

B) Manual validation in services
   - Custom validation logic
   - More flexible but error-prone

Sanitization rules:

A) ✅ Sanitize all string inputs (XSS prevention)
   - Strip HTML tags: [yes/no]
   - Escape special characters: [yes/no]
   - Library: [DOMPurify/validator.js/bleach]

B) ✅ SQL Injection prevention
   - Use parameterized queries (ORM handles this automatically)
   - Never concatenate user input in queries

Request size limits:

- Max JSON body size: __ MB (recommended: 1-10 MB)
- Max file upload size: __ MB (recommended: 10-50 MB)
- Max URL length: __ characters (recommended: 2048)

File upload validation (if applicable from Phase 3.9):

- Allowed file types: [jpg, png, pdf, etc.]
- MIME type validation: [yes/no - verify actual content matches extension]
- File content validation: [yes/no - check file headers]
- Virus scanning: [yes/no - ClamAV, VirusTotal API]
- Filename sanitization: [yes/no - remove special characters, limit length]

Content-Type enforcement:

A) ⭐ Strict - Reject if Content-Type doesn't match body (recommended)
B) Lenient - Accept common mismatches (application/json vs text/plain)
C) No validation

Validation approach:

A) ⭐ Whitelist - Only allow known good inputs (recommended)
   - Define allowed values explicitly
   - Reject everything else

B) Blacklist - Block known bad inputs (not recommended)
   - Easy to bypass
   - Incomplete protection

Special character handling:

- Allow special characters in: [names, descriptions, etc.]
- Escape/encode for: [HTML output, SQL queries, shell commands]
- Reject in: [IDs, slugs, filenames]
```
